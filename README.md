### Abstract
Sentiment analysis is a sub-field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on the
categorization of subjective opinion of the text (positive, negative, or neutral). There are two main
components to sentiment analysis in natural language processing: feature extraction and the machine learning model. In this paper, we examine sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Specifically,
we explore the use of different feature extraction techniques (3-grams, 4-grams, bag of words, and
tf-idf) and different machine learning models (naive Bayes classifiers, SVM, logistic regression) to
compare the model accuracy. The tf-idf feature extraction technique in conjunction with logistic
regression was shown to have the best performance.
